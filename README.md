No need to install. The application can be used via the link provided in the deployed link section. 

## About

I started this project by taking the information and instructiosn from the inital README and strated psudeo coding the steps I needed to take. 

I knew that the application had to do these following points - 

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Prompt about length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
      * If the user wanted lowercase characters 
      * If the user wanted uppercase characters 
      * If the user wanted numbers
      * If the user wanted special characters

The first thing I needed to do was be able to generate the password options. By putting the choices in a function which was the option of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters. 

The next thing was to create an array to return a random element. I used Math.random() to generate a random decimal between 0 and 1. Then I used Math.floor to get a whole number index.

Then I created the empty arry which was 'possible characters' which returned a result of desired characters and length that was selected via the prompts. 

Then I used document.querySelector to select the "Generate Password" button by its ID and then uded addEventListener to attach the writePassword function to the button's click event. I then used document.querySelector to select the password textarea and store it in the passwordText variable.

Now, when a user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the complete process is executed, and the generated password is displayed on the page. Attached below are a screen shot of the prompts and the application in action.

## Once the 'Generate Password' button has been clicked it brings up the first prompt which is asking you for the length of your password.

## It then brings up the prompt if you want to include lowercase characters.

## It then brings up the prompt if you want to include numbers. For the purposes of demonstation, I clicked 'cancel' here which acts as a 'no' feature.

## This was the final output. 10 characters including uppercase, lowercase and special characters but no numbers.

I had to do a lot of research for this project but I feel very happy in making this work and learning how to make this applictaion operate.

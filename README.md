## About

I started this project by taking the information and instructiosn from the inital README and strated psudeo coding the steps I needed to take. 

I knew that the application had to do these following points - 

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Prompt about length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
      * If the user wanted lowercase characters 
      * If the user wanted uppercase characters 
      * If the user wanted numbers
      * If the user wanted special characters

The first thing I needed to do was be able to generate the password options. By putting the choices in a function which was the option of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters. 

The next thing was to create an array to return a random element. I used Math.random() to generate a random decimal between 0 and 1. Then I used Math.floor to get a whole number index.
